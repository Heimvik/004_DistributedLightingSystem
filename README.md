# FleetPlanningSoftware
The purpose of this project is to deliver a streamlined solution for a contact in the transportation industry, addressing the challenge of manually planning routes on a daily basis. Currently, the process of scheduling routes requires significant time and effort, which can lead to inefficiencies and human errors. This solution aims to automate the route planning process, ensuring that routes are optimized based on various factors such as distance, traffic, and delivery priorities.

By eliminating the need for manual intervention, this system will not only save time but also increase operational efficiency and accuracy. The automation process will adapt to dynamic variables like changing traffic conditions, delivery schedules, and vehicle availability, ensuring that the most optimal routes are generated every day with minimal oversight.

This project is designed to scale and can be customized to suit different transportation needs, including fleet size, route complexity, and specific business requirements.
