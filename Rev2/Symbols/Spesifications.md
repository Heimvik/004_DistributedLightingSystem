# Distributed LED System Specifications

## System Overview

The distributed LED system consists of several nodes, each controlling a 1-meter long LED strip. All nodes communicate with a central master node responsible for signal processing and coordinating the display patterns across all connected nodes. The system will support various lighting modes, including synchronization with music and spatial sound effects.

## System Components

- **Master Node**: Central processing unit responsible for signal processing, data transmission, and coordination of LED patterns across all slave nodes.
- **Slave Nodes**: Each node controls a 1-meter long LED strip and receives display instructions from the master node.
- **LED Strip**: Each LED strip is 1 meter long and consists of individually addressable RGB LEDs.

## Requirements

### 1. LED Strip Specifications

- **Number of LEDs per Strip**: 60 LEDs per meter (common specification for high-density strips).
- **Total Number of LEDs per Node**: 60 LEDs.

### 2. Power Consumption

- **Power Consumption per LED**: Approximately 0.24 watts (at full brightness, white).
- **Total Power Consumption per Node (White Standby)**: 
  - `60 LEDs x 0.24 watts/LED = 14.4 watts`.
  - Include an additional 10% margin for power supply inefficiencies and other components.
  - **Total Power Consumption per Node**: ~15.8 watts.

### 3. Communication Protocol

- **Master to Slave Communication**: Use a reliable communication protocol such as MQTT, HTTP, or a custom UDP/TCP protocol depending on latency and bandwidth requirements.
- **Data Transmission Rate**: Ensure data transmission supports real-time updates with minimal latency.

### 4. Lighting Modes

1. **Static Colors**: Fixed colors set by the master node.
2. **Dynamic Patterns**: Predefined or custom patterns such as waves, color shifts, and fades.
3. **Music Synchronization**:
   - **Beat Detection**: LEDs synchronize with the beats of the music.
   - **Frequency Bands**: Different frequency bands can control different LED segments or effects.
4. **Spatial Sound Effects**:
   - **Directionality**: LEDs placemnt in the room respond to distribution of sound between the channels.
   - **Sound Mapping**: Visual representation of sound sources or sound movement across the LED strips.

### 5. System Integration

- **Node Initialization**: Each node should be able to initialize and configure itself upon startup.
- **Scalability**: More nodes needs to be able to be added with no/minimum effort.

### 6. User Interface

- **Control Software**: Develop a user-friendly interface for controlling and configuring the system, including setting lighting modes and creating patterns.
- **Remote Access**: Provide options for remote control and monitoring of the system via a web interface or mobile app.

### 7. Power Supply

- **Power Supply Requirements**: Ensure each node has a stable and sufficient power supply.
- **Safety**: Include protection against overcurrent, short circuits, and overheating.

### 8. Environmental Considerations

- **Temperature Range**: Ensure the system operates reliably within the expected temperature range.
- **Humidity**: Consider humidity and potential exposure to moisture, especially for non-indoor installations.

### 9. Documentation

- **System Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for setup, configuration, and troubleshooting.
- **API Documentation**: Document any APIs or communication protocols used for integration and control.

### 10. Testing and Validation

- **Functional Testing**: Validate all features and modes to ensure proper functionality.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the system's performance under various loads and conditions to ensure stability and responsiveness.
